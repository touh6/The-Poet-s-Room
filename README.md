# The-Poet-s-Room
An Interactive Portfolio For Poets/Writers
Inspiration
Poetry is more than words—it's emotion, memory, and identity. We wanted to create a digital space that feels like stepping into a poet's mind. The idea behind The Poet's Room was to make an immersive, interactive portfolio that not only showcases poetry but allows people to feel it. Inspired by cozy creative rooms, daydreams, and the power of thought, we imagined a space where every click leads deeper into the heart of a writer.

What it does
The Poet’s Room is an interactive portfolio experience for poets and creatives. Upon entering through a poetic-themed door animation, users arrive in a softly animated room where a character sits at a desk with headphones on—lost in thought. Floating above are interactive thought bubbles linking to:
About Me – a poetic introduction to the creator
Poetry – a collection of written works
Listen to Poetry – audio poetry for immersive listening


How we built it
We used Framer as our core platform to design and animate the site, creating a seamless interactive experience. For the 3D and animated visual elements, we used Spline, which we embedded into Framer. This allowed us to craft an engaging, storybook-like room with floating thoughts and smooth transitions. The project was built with zero-code tools, making it accessible to non-coders while still delivering a polished result.

Challenges we ran into
Learning Curve: This was our first time using Framer and Spline, so figuring out UI states, animations, and component linking took some trial and error.


Limited Time: Designing and building everything from scratch in just a few days was intense!


Balance: Making the room poetic and dreamy while ensuring clarity and usability was tricky. We didn’t want the style to overpower the substance.



Accomplishments that we're proud of
Created a fully functional, animated portfolio without writing a single line of traditional code


Designed a space that feels emotionally rich and visually unique


Learned and applied two new platforms (Framer + Spline) from scratch in under 4 days


Received positive feedback for the storytelling and aesthetics!



What we learned
How to build and prototype in Framer and bring in 3D assets from Spline


The power of design tools to tell stories, not just build interfaces


How visual language can enhance emotional storytelling, especially in creative portfolios


How to balance creative ambition with technical limitations in a short timeframe



What's next for The Poet's Room
Mobile Optimization – make the room experience smooth and accessible on all devices


Interactive Poetry Generator – powered by AI, where users can create or co-write poems with the poet’s style


Room Customization – allow other poets to customize the space for their own portfolios


Performance Tweaks – improve load times and add subtle audio effects for an even richer experience


The Poet’s Room is just the beginning—we see it evolving into a platform for all poetic souls to express, connect, and be heard.
